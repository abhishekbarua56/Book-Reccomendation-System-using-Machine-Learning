# Book Recommendation System - Unsupervised Learning Project

## Project Description

The Book Recommendation System project aims to provide personalized book recommendations using unsupervised learning techniques. By analyzing user preferences and book characteristics, the system suggests books that align with the interests of individual users. This project leverages collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to enhance the user experience and increase book discoverability.

## Objectives

- To develop a recommendation system that suggests books based on user preferences and book features.
- To implement various algorithms, including collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
- To evaluate the performance of the recommendation system and refine its accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for running Python code and visualizing results.
- **Pandas**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computations that complements Pandas.
- **Scikit-learn**: A library providing simple and efficient tools for data mining and machine learning.
- **Surprise**: A Python library for building and analyzing recommender systems.

## Data Sources

The dataset used in this project comprises user ratings, book details, and user information, including:

- **User_ID**: Unique identifier for each user.
- **Book_ID**: Unique identifier for each book.
- **Rating**: User rating for the book.
- **Book_Title**: Title of the book.
- **Author**: Author of the book.
- **Genre**: Genre or category of the book.

## Key Steps and Methods

### Data Preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Values**: Addressed missing data by removing or imputing based on statistical methods.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features such as average ratings and genre counts to enhance the model's performance.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Converted categorical variables into numerical formats suitable for modeling.

### Model Implementation

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Used techniques like user-based and item-based collaborative filtering to recommend books based on user similarity.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Implemented content-based recommendations using book attributes like genre and author.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combined both methods to improve the recommendation accuracy.

### Model Evaluation

- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **User Feedback**: Incorporated user feedback for iterative improvements to the recommendation system.

## Instructions to Run the Project

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhishekbarua56/Book-Reccomendation-System-using-Machine-Learning
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Book-Reccomendation-System-using-Machine-Learning
```

Open the Jupyter Notebook (Book_Recommendation_System_(Unsupervised_Learning_Project).ipynb) in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells in order.

## Usage Examples

The following code snippet demonstrates how to make book recommendations using the trained model:

```python
import pandas as pd
from surprise import Reader, Dataset
from surprise import SVD
from surprise.model_selection import train_test_split
from surprise import accuracy

# Load the dataset
data = Dataset.load_from_df(pd.read_csv('ratings.csv'), Reader())

# Split the data into train and test sets
trainset, testset = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2)

# Train the model
model = SVD()
model.fit(trainset)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.test(testset)
print("Recommendations generated successfully.")
```

## Results

The Book Recommendation System achieved an RMSE of [insert RMSE value] and a MAE of [insert MAE value], indicating a robust performance in recommending books. Key findings from the analysis included:

- The effectiveness of collaborative filtering for user-based recommendations.
- Insights into user preferences and popular genres.

Visualizations and detailed metrics can be found throughout the Jupyter Notebook.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Feature Engineering**: Introduce more user and book attributes to improve recommendations.
- **Model Optimization**: Experiment with advanced algorithms, such as deep learning-based recommendations.
- **Real-Time Recommendations**: Develop a web application for users to receive real-time book suggestions.
