Unsupervised Learning

The Book Recommendation System is an unsupervised learning project designed to suggest personalized book recommendations to users based on their reading behavior. Utilizing techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and matrix factorization, the system analyzes user-book interaction data to identify patterns and similarities between users and books. This approach enables the model to provide accurate recommendations without requiring explicit user ratings. The project focuses on enhancing user engagement and helping readers discover new books tailored to their preferences, ultimately improving the overall user experience.
