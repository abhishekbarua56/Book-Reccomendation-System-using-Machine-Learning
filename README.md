# Book-Reccomendation-System-using-Machine-Learning
Unsupervised Learning

## Project Overview
This project develops a book recommendation system utilizing unsupervised learning techniques. The system aims to provide personalized book recommendations based on user preferences, reading patterns, and historical data. 

## Motivation
With the vast number of books available, users often face difficulties in finding books that match their interests. This project seeks to simplify the process of discovering new reads by leveraging machine learning algorithms to enhance user experience and increase engagement.

## Dataset
- **Source**: AlmaBetter's Team
- **Description**: The dataset consists of various books, including metadata such as title, author, genre, and user ratings.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Book Title**: The name of the book.
  - **Author**: The author of the book.
  - **Genre**: The category or genre of the book.
  - **User Ratings**: Ratings provided by users, typically on a scale of 1-5.
  - **User Reviews**: Textual feedback provided by users regarding their reading experience.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset was gathered from [specify the source] to include a comprehensive range of books and user data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing text fields.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed user ratings, trends in book genres, and relationships between different features to gain insights into user preferences.
4. **Modeling**: Implemented various unsupervised learning algorithms, including:
   - **Collaborative Filtering**: Analyzes user behavior and preferences to recommend books based on similar user profiles.
   - **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses book attributes to recommend similar books based on a user's previous choices.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessed recommendation quality using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure the effectiveness of the model.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy` for numerical computations.
  - `scikit-learn` for implementing machine learning algorithms.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization and exploratory analysis.
  - `nltk` or `spaCy` for natural language processing tasks.

## Results
The recommendation system effectively suggests books tailored to user preferences, showcasing a diverse range of genres. Visualizations demonstrate the relationships between user ratings and recommended books, highlighting trends and patterns in user behavior.

### Key Insights:
- Most popular genres among users based on ratings.
- Trends in user preferences over time.
- Visualization of recommended books vs. actual user ratings.

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhishekbarua56/Book-Reccomendation-System-using-Machine-Learning.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Book-Reccomendation-System-using-Machine-Learning
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `Book_Recommendation_System_(Unsupervised_Learning_Project).ipynb`.

## Future Work
- Enhance the recommendation algorithm by incorporating user feedback and behavior tracking to improve accuracy.
- Explore advanced models such as deep learning techniques (e.g., neural collaborative filtering) for more sophisticated recommendations.
- Expand the dataset to include additional features like book summaries or user demographic information.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning in creating a book recommendation system. It helps users discover new books that align with their tastes and preferences while providing insights into reading trends and user behavior.
